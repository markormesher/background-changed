If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Think like a man of action,//act like a man of thought.
The hurrier I go, the behinder I get.
The man who chases two rabbit catches neither of them.
We all must face the pain of discipline,//or the pain of regret.
The ancestor of every action is a thought.
The mind is for having ideas,//not holding them.
'Good enough' is not good enough.
Start where you are.//Use what you know.//Do what you can.
The best time to start was yesterday.//The second-best time is now.
